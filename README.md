Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the deadlines for registration in 2020.
    - I have to do some math to find the early voting dates in 2020.
    - I can't find any deadlines for absentee voting in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Home page is not called index.html, which is the traditional name.
    - Could put the "Our Board" info on the home page so there's something there.
    - The Registration and Absentee Voting pages are a little lengthy and could use a bit more internal structure.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The fixed-size header image causes some problems with alignment.
