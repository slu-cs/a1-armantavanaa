          <h5>Registering In Person</h5>
          <p>Registration forms are available at most government offices and post offices, or you may register in person Monday through Friday at the St. Lawrence County Board of Elections Office, 80 State Hwy 310, Canton, New York, between 9am and 5pm.

          <h5>Choosing the Correct Form</h5>
          <p>When registering to vote via the DMV make sure you receive the correct form. One form allows you to register for the first time, the other form is used if you've moved within St. Lawrence County and wish to notify the Board of Elections of your new address to maintain active voting status. Also note it can take up to a month for registrations from the DMV and other social service agencies to reach the board. Therefore your registration will be postmarked timely as of the date received by the St. Lawrence County Board of Elections.</p>

          <p>If you want to vote in an election, you must mail or deliver your completed registration form to the Board of Elections no later than 25 days before the election in which you want to vote. Your eligibility to vote will be based on the date you file this form, and the county board will notify you of such. </p>
